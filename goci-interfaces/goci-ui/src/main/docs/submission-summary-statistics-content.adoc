=== Additional information

==== What if I can't tell which study is which?

If you need more information to identify each study, you can find additional details at the GWAS Catalog website, on the relevant publication page (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/ + the PMID of the publication).

==== What if the prefilled data is incorrect?

If you think there is a mistake in the pre-filled spreadsheet (e.g. the wrong number of studies), please contact gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk.
