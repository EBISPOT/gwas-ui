== [[A]]A. Finding your publication

The first step is to find your publication in the GWAS Catalog Submission system.

=== [[link-1]]1. Log in to the submission page

First, open the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/deposition[GWAS Catalog Submission page^].

To get started, click LOGIN in the top right corner of the submission page.

Log in using an Elixir identity, or follow the link to register. You can register using an existing account e.g. a university, ORCID or Google account.

=== [[link-2]]2. Find publication

On the GWAS Catalog Submission page, you can find any publication that is included in the GWAS Catalog, or that has been identified by curators as eligible for inclusion.

You can search for a publication by *PMID* or *first author*. Publications matching your search are displayed in the table.

==== What if my publication is not in the table?

A publication will not appear in the table if:

* it has not yet been indexed in PubMed
* it has been missed by our literature search, or
* it does not meet our eligibility criteria

If you think that we are missing an eligible publication, or if you want to submit data that is not yet published, please contact us at gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk to request an eligibility review.

=== [[link-3]]3. Check publication status

The Status of the publication tells you which type of data can be submitted.

=== [[link-4]]4. Select publication

Once you have found your publication, click on the PMID to open the Publication Details page.

== [[B]]B. Creating a submission

The Publication Details page gives a brief summary of the publication and a list of prerequisites for submission. You will need to complete each of the items on the checklist before proceeding with the submission.

=== [[link-5]]1. Create Elixir ID

You can tick this box if you have already logged in.

Otherwise, first follow the https://elixir-europe.org/register[Elixir ID link] and click Register to create an account.

=== [[link-6]]2. Install Globus Connect Personal

We use Globus to enable the transfer of summary statistics files to the GWAS Catalog.

First, you will need to download and install the Globus Connect Personal application, which allows Globus to access files from your computer. Follow the https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal[Globus Connect Personal link] and then select the appropriate link for your operating system.

Then follow the *Installation* steps to install and run the application.

Take note of the email address associated with your Globus Connect Personal endpoint. You will need this for the next step.

=== [[link-7]]3. Enter registered Globus email

Enter the email address associated with your Globus account. It should be filled automatically, but you can change it if needed.

image::enter_email.png[Enter Globus email,width=800,align="center"]

=== [[link-8]]4. Format and validate summary statistics

To avoid errors later, please make sure that your summary statistics files conform to our standard format and content. Follow the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/summary-statistics-format[Format and validate link] for formatting instructions and to access our offline summary statistics validator.

=== [[link-9]]5. Create submission

Please tick each box in the checklist to confirm that the prerequisites have been completed.

You can then click "Create Submission" to continue.

== [[C]]C. Uploading data

After you have created a submission, you will be able to upload your summary statistics and supporting information. 

=== [[link-10]]1. Upload summary statistics

The first step is to upload your summary statistics files. When you create a submission, a folder is created for you. You can transfer your summary statistics to this location using Globus. Click "Upload summary statistics" to go to the Globus File Manager.

The GWAS Catalog submission folder will appear in the left-hand panel, with a Collection name beginning *ebi#gwas#*, followed by the date and some other characters.

image::file_manager.png[Globus File Manager,width=800,align="center"]

In the right-hand panel, click on the Search box and then select your Globus Connect Personal endpoint from the *Your Collections* tab.  This should have the name that you entered when installing Globus Connect Personal in <<link-6, step B2>>.

image::search_collection.png[Search for your collection,width=800,align="center"]

image::select_collection.png[Select your collection,width=800,align="center"]

You should now see the GWAS Catalog submission folder side by side with your own computer’s file system.

Now you can drag and drop the summary stats files you want to upload from the right window to the left window.

image::drag_and_drop.png[Drag and drop summary statistics,width=800,align="center"]

A message will appear when the files have been transferred. Note that you may not see them in the left window straight away, but they should appear when you click Refresh.

=== [[link-11]]2. Download submission form

You will now need to provide some additional information to support the summary statistics files.

Return to the Submission page and click "Download submission form" to download an Excel spreadsheet where you can enter this information. Save the form to your computer to complete offline.

Please download a new form each time you submit a new publication, to make sure you have the most correct and up-to-date form for your specific submission.

=== [[link-12]]3. Fill in submission form

The contents of the form depend on whether the publication is OPEN FOR SUBMISSION or OPEN FOR SUMMARY STATISTICS SUBMISSION (see <<link-3, step A3 above>>).

For help filling in the submission form, follow the link from the submission interface, or select the relevant link below:

1. Instructions for https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/submission-summary-statistics[ summary statistics only^], or

2. Instructions for https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/submission-summary-statistics-plus-metadata[summary statistics plus study metadata^]

=== [[link-13]]4. Upload submission form

Once you have completed the submission form, save it and click "Upload submission form". You can drag and drop the file onto the cloud icon, or click it to select the file from your computer.

Click "Upload file" and then "Start validation".

The validation pipeline first checks the uploaded submission form. If this passes, it goes on to check the summary statistics files themselves. Validation may take some time, but feel free to leave the page - you will receive an email when validation is complete, or if an error is detected, with a link back to the submission page.

The Submission Report displays a brief summary of the uploaded data as well as any errors. You can click "Review submission" to download and check the current submission form, or "Reset" to delete the current form and start again.

=== [[link-14]]5. Submit

Once the submission has successfully validated, click "Submit" to complete the submission.

You will be taken to the My Submissions page, where you can see your latest submission at the top, with the status SUBMITTED.

A curator will then review your submission and make the summary statistics available to the public as soon as possible through the GWAS Catalog website.

== [[D]] Additional Information
