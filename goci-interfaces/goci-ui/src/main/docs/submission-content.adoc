On the GWAS Catalog Submission page, you can find any publication that is included in the GWAS Catalog, or that has been identified by curators as eligible for inclusion.

You can search for a publication by *PMID* or *first author*. Publications matching your search are displayed in the table.

==== What if my publication is not in the table?

A publication will not appear in the table if:

* it has not yet been indexed in PubMed
* it has been missed by our literature search, or
* it does not meet our eligibility criteria

If you think that we are missing an eligible publication, or if you want to submit data that is not yet published, please contact us at gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk to request an eligibility review.

=== [[link-3]]3. Check publication status

The Status of the publication tells you which type of data can be submitted.

==== Step 1: Log in to Globus

First log into Globus, by going to https://www.globus.org and clicking LOGIN.

==== Step 2: Download Globus Connect Personal

If you want to transfer files from your own personal computer, you will need to install the Globus Connect Personal application. If you are already familiar with Globus and have your summary statistics files in an existing collection, you can skip this step.

  * Select “Transfer or Sync to…” from the right hand window.
