== [[A]]A. Finding your publication

The first step is to find your publication on the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/deposition[GWAS Catalog Submission page^].

=== [[link-1]]1. Find publication

On the GWAS Catalog Submission page, you can find any publication that is included in the GWAS Catalog, or that has been identified by curators as eligible for inclusion (see https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/methods/criteria[inclusion criteria]).

You can search for a publication by *PMID* (PubMed identifier) or *first author*. Publications matching your search are displayed in the table.

==== What if my publication is not in the table?

A publication will not appear in the table if:

* it has not yet been indexed in PubMed
* it has been missed by our literature search, or
* it does not meet our https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/methods/criteria[inclusion criteria]

If you think that we are missing an eligible publication, or if you want to submit data that is not yet published, please contact us at gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk to request an eligibility review.

=== [[link-2]]2. Check publication status

Publications listed on the Submission page may be at various stages of curation. For some, we have curated both the metadata (i.e. information about the trait, sample, genotyping and analysis methods) and summary statistics, therefore no further submissions are required. In other cases, one or both of these pieces of information is still missing and therefore open for direct submission by authors through the Submission page.

The Status of the publication tells you which type of data can be submitted.

=== [[link-3]]3. Select publication

Once you have found your publication, click on the PMID to open the Publication Details page.

== [[B]]B. Creating a submission

The Publication Details page gives a brief summary of the publication and a list of prerequisites for submission. You will need to complete each of the items on the checklist before proceeding with the submission.

image::pre_sub_checklist.png[Pre-submission checklist,width=800,align="center"]

=== [[link-5]]1. Create Elixir ID

In order to create a submission, you will need to create an account and log in. User accounts are managed using the ELIXIR Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure, which is shared across multiple life science services. You can find https://elixir-europe.org/services/compute/aai[more information about ELIXIR here]. 

First, create an ELIXIR identity if you do not already have one: follow the https://elixir-europe.org/register[Elixir ID link^] and click Register. You can create an ELIXIR identity using an existing account, including Google, LinkedIn, ORCID and most academic institutions.

Second, using your ELIXIR identity, click on "ELIXIR LOGIN" on the GWAS Catalog Submission page to continue.

=== [[link-6]]2. Install Globus Connect Personal

We use Globus to enable the transfer of summary statistics files to the GWAS Catalog.

First, you will need to download and install the Globus Connect Personal application, which allows Globus to access files from your computer. Follow the https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal[Globus Connect Personal link^] and then select the appropriate link for your operating system.

{empty}

Then follow the *Installation* steps to install and run the application.

Take note of the email address associated with your Globus Connect Personal endpoint. You will need this for the next step.

image::globus_email.png[Publication search results,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

=== [[link-7]]3. Enter registered Globus email

Enter the email address associated with your Globus account. It should be filled automatically, but you can change it if needed.

image::enter_email.png[Enter Globus email,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

=== [[link-8]]4. Format and validate summary statistics

To avoid errors later, please make sure that your summary statistics files conform to our standard format and content. Follow the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/summary-statistics-format[Format and validate link^] for formatting instructions and to access our offline summary statistics validator.

=== [[link-9]]5. Create submission

Please tick each box in the checklist to confirm that the prerequisites have been completed.

You can then click "Create Submission" to continue.

== [[C]]C. Uploading data

After you have created a submission, you will be able to upload your summary statistics and supporting information. 

=== [[link-10]]1. Upload summary statistics

The first step is to upload your summary statistics files. When you create a submission, a folder is created for you. You can transfer your summary statistics to this location using Globus.

On the Submission Details page, click "Upload summary statistics" to open the Globus File Manager in a new tab.

image::upload_sum_stats.png[Upload summary statistics,width=300,align="center"]

{empty}

In the Globus File Manager, the GWAS Catalog submission folder will appear in the left-hand panel. It will have a Collection name beginning *ebi#gwas#*, followed by the creation date and some additional characters.

image::file_manager.png[Globus File Manager,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

In the right-hand panel, click on the Search box and then select your Globus Connect Personal endpoint from the *Your Collections* tab.  This should have the name that you entered when installing Globus Connect Personal in <<link-6, step B2>>.

image::search_collection.png[Search for your collection,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

image::select_collection.png[Select your collection,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

You should now see the GWAS Catalog submission folder side by side with your own computer’s file system.

Now you can drag and drop the summary stats files you want to upload from the right window to the left window.

image::drag_and_drop.png[Drag and drop summary statistics,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

A message will appear when the transfer request has successfully started. Large files may take some time to transfer, but you do not need to wait until it is finished - the transfer will continue in the background while you complete the rest of your submission.

=== [[link-11]]2. Download submission form

You will now need to provide some additional information to support the summary statistics files.

Return to the Submission page and click "Download submission form" to download an Excel spreadsheet where you can enter this information. Save the form to your computer to complete offline.

Please download a new form each time you create a new submission for a publication, to make sure you have the most correct and up-to-date form for your specific submission.

=== [[link-12]]3. Fill in submission form

The information that you need to enter into the submission form depends on whether the publication is OPEN FOR SUBMISSION or OPEN FOR SUMMARY STATISTICS SUBMISSION (see <<link-2, step A2 above>>).

For help filling in the submission form, follow the link from the submission interface, or select the relevant link below:

1. Instructions for https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/submission-summary-statistics[summary statistics only^], or

2. Instructions for https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/submission-summary-statistics-plus-metadata[summary statistics plus study metadata^]

=== [[link-13]]4. Upload submission form

Once you have completed the submission form, save it and click "Upload submission form". You can drag and drop the file onto the cloud icon, or click it to select the file from your computer.

Click "Upload file" and then "Start validation".

The validation pipeline first checks the uploaded submission form. If this passes, it goes on to check the summary statistics files themselves. Validation may take some time, but feel free to leave the page - you will receive an email when validation is complete, or if an error is detected, with a link back to the submission page.

The Submission Report displays a brief summary of the uploaded data as well as any errors. You can click "Review submission" to download and check the current submission form, or "Reset" to delete that submission form and start again.

=== [[link-14]]5. Submit

Once the submission has successfully validated, click "Submit" to complete the submission.

You will be taken to the My Submissions page, where you can see your latest submission at the top, with the status SUBMITTED.

A curator will then review your submission and make the summary statistics available to the public as soon as possible through the GWAS Catalog website.
