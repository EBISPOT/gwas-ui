== [[A]]A. Preparing for submission

=== [[link-1]]Submission homepage

Start by going to the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/deposition[GWAS Catalog Submission homepage^].

=== [[link-2]]Format and validate summary statistics

Before submitting, please make sure that your summary statistics files conform to our standard format. This will make your summary statistics interoperable with other datasets and help others to make use of your results. Click https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/summary-statistics-format[here for instructions and to download our validator tool].

=== [[link-3]]Submission questionnaire

Next, please provide some metadata about the broader body of work to which your summary statistics submission relates. For example, your submission might be linked to a publication or to an unpublished manuscript, or you may wish to submit summary statistics for GWAS experiments that are not currently written up in a manuscript format.

Click the "Get started" button from the Submission homepage and then follow the questionnaire to find the appropriate scenario.

==== Publications indexed in PubMed

GWAS publications that are indexed in PubMed should have already been identified by curators as eligible for inclusion in the GWAS Catalog. In this case, simply search for your publication by *PMID* (PubMed identifier) or *first author*. Publications matching your search are displayed in the table. 

image::pub_search.png[Publication search results,width=800,align="center"]

The Status of the publication tells you which type of data can be submitted.

|Instructions

|OPEN FOR SUMMARY STATISTICS SUBMISSION
|
|The publication has been curated and the publication metadata is already available on the GWAS Catalog website. Please submit *summary statistics only*.

|OPEN FOR SUBMISSION
|
|The publication meets the GWAS Catalog’s inclusion criteria, but has not yet been curated. Please submit *summary statistics plus study metadata*.
  
|CLOSED
|
|We are not currently accepting submissions for this publication. We either have the summary statistics already, or the publication is under submission by another author or curator. You may want to check with your co-authors, or contact us at gwas-subs@ebi.ac.uk for more information.
|===

Once you have found your publication, click on the PMID to open the Details page.

A publication will not appear in the table if:

* it has not yet been indexed in PubMed
* it has been missed by our literature search, or
* we have determined that it does not meet our https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/methods/criteria[inclusion criteria]

If you think that we are missing an eligible publication, please contact us at gwas-subs@ebi.ac.uk.

==== Other scenarios

For all other scenarios, please complete the form to provide metadata about your manuscript or other body of work. Click "Submit" to continue to the Details page.

== [[B]]B. Creating a submission

The Details page gives a brief summary of the publication (or other body of work) and a list of prerequisites for submission. You will need to complete each of the items on the checklist before proceeding with the submission.

image::pre_sub_checklist.png[Pre-submission checklist,width=800,align="center"]

=== [[link-5]]1. Create Elixir ID

In order to create a submission, you will need to create an account and log in. User accounts are managed using the ELIXIR Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure, which is shared across multiple life science services. You can find https://elixir-europe.org/services/compute/aai[more information about ELIXIR here]. 

First, create an ELIXIR identity if you do not already have one: follow the https://elixir-europe.org/register[Elixir ID link^] and click Register. You can create an ELIXIR identity using an existing account, including Google, LinkedIn, ORCID and most academic institutions.

Second, using your ELIXIR identity, click on "ELIXIR LOGIN" on the GWAS Catalog Submission page to continue.

=== [[link-6]]2. Install Globus Connect Personal

We use Globus to enable the transfer of summary statistics files to the GWAS Catalog.

First, you will need to download and install the Globus Connect Personal application, which allows Globus to access files from your computer. Follow the https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal[Globus Connect Personal link^] and then select the appropriate link for your operating system.

image::gcp_install.png[Install GCP,width=400,align="center"]

{empty}

Then follow the *Installation* steps to install and run the application.

Take note of the email address associated with your Globus Connect Personal endpoint. You will need this for the next step.

image::globus_email.png[Publication search results,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

=== [[link-7]]3. Enter registered Globus email

Enter the email address associated with your Globus account. It should be filled automatically, but you can change it if needed.

image::enter_email.png[Enter Globus email,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

=== [[link-8]]4. Format and validate summary statistics

To avoid errors later, please make sure that your summary statistics files conform to our standard format and content. Follow the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/summary-statistics-format[Format and validate link^] for formatting instructions and to access our offline summary statistics validator.

=== [[link-9]]5. Create submission

Please tick each box in the checklist to confirm that the prerequisites have been completed.

You can then click "Create Submission" to continue.

image::create_sub.png[Create Submission,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

== [[C]]C. Uploading data

After you have created a submission, you will be able to upload your summary statistics and supporting information. 

=== [[link-10]]1. Upload summary statistics

The first step is to upload your summary statistics files. When you create a submission, a folder is created for you. You can transfer your summary statistics to this location using Globus.

On the Submission Details page, click "Upload summary statistics" to open the Globus File Manager in a new tab.

image::upload_sum_stats.png[Upload summary statistics,width=300,align="center"]

{empty}

In the Globus File Manager, the GWAS Catalog submission folder will appear in the left-hand panel. It will have a Collection name beginning *ebi#gwas#*, followed by the creation date and some additional characters.

image::file_manager.png[Globus File Manager,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

In the right-hand panel, click on the Search box and then select your Globus Connect Personal endpoint from the *Your Collections* tab.  This should have the name that you entered when installing Globus Connect Personal in <<link-6, step B2>>.

image::search_collection.png[Search for your collection,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

image::select_collection.png[Select your collection,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

You should now see the GWAS Catalog submission folder side by side with your own computer’s file system.

Now you can drag and drop the summary stats files you want to upload from the right window to the left window.

image::drag_and_drop.png[Drag and drop summary statistics,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

A message will appear when the transfer request has successfully started. Large files may take some time to transfer, but you do not need to wait until this is finished - the transfer will continue in the background while you proceed with the next step. You do however need to wait for confirmation of file transfer before clicking "Submit submission form" (step 3).

=== [[link-11]]2. Download submission form

You will now need to provide some additional information to support the summary statistics files.

Return to the Submission page and click "Download submission form" to download an Excel spreadsheet where you can enter this information. Save the form to your computer to complete offline.

image::download_form.png[Download submission form,width=300,align="center"]

{empty}

Please download a new form each time you create a new submission for a publication, to make sure you have the most correct and up-to-date form for your specific submission.

=== [[link-12]]3. Fill in submission form

For help filling in the submission form, follow the link from the submission interface, or select the relevant link below:

1. Instructions for https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/submission-summary-statistics[summary statistics only^], or

2. Instructions for https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/submission-summary-statistics-plus-metadata[summary statistics plus study metadata^]

=== [[link-13]]4. Submit submission form

Once you have completed the submission form, save it and click "Submit submission form".

image::submit_form.png[Submit submission form,width=300,align="center"]

{empty}

You can drag and drop the file onto the cloud icon, or click it to select the file from your computer. Click "Upload file" and then "Start validation".

image::upload_file.png[Upload file,width=600,align="center"]

image::start_validation.png[Start validation,width=500,align="center"]

{empty}

The validation pipeline first checks the uploaded submission form. If this passes, it goes on to check the summary statistics files themselves. Validation may take some time, but feel free to leave the page.

If the uploaded form and summary statistics pass validation, these will be automatically submitted. You will receive an email when validation is complete, with a list of accession number for the submitted studies.

If validation fails, you will receive an email listing the errors detected and a link back to the submission page. There you can click "Review submission" to download and edit the current submission form, and click "Reset" to delete the submission form and start again.

image::review_reset.png[Review or reset,width=300,align="center"]

=== [[link-14]]5. After submission

After submission, you will be taken to the My Submissions page (see below), where you can see your latest submission, now with the status SUBMITTED.

For submissions associated with a published manuscript, a curator will then review your submission and make the summary statistics available to the public as soon as possible through the GWAS Catalog website. We will let you know when these are available.

For unpublished data submissions, or those associated with a preprint, each summary statistics file will be made available via direct link on our ftp server within 48 hours, or at the end of your embargo if you have requested one. The direct links take the format ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/summary_statistics/GCSTXXXXXXXX. Following our biweekly data release, the studies will also be listed in the summary statistics download area https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/downloads/summary-statistics and associated metadata will be available to download via https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads.
