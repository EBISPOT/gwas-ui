= Getting started

Authors of GWAS publications can now submit full p-value summary statistics using our submission interface through the following steps:

*1. Log in
*2. Find publication
*3. Create a submission
*4. submit

== 1. Logging in to the submission page

To get started, click LOGIN in the top right corner of the submission page.

Log in using your ELIXIR identity, or follow the link to register. Your ELIXIR identity may be linked to Google, LinkedIn, ORCID or an institutional account.

== 2. Finding my publication

On the GWAS Catalog Submission page, you can find any publication that is included in the GWAS Catalog, or that has been identified by curators as eligible for inclusion.  You can search for a publication by *PubMed ID* or *first author*. Publications matching your search are displayed in the table.

== What if my publication is not in the table?

A publication will not appear in the table if:

* it has not yet been indexed in PubMed
* it has been missed by our literature search, or
* curators have reviewed the publication and found that it does not meet our eligibility criteria

If you think that we are missing an eligible publication, or if you want to submit data that is not yet published, please contact us at gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk to request an eligibility review.

== What can I submit?

The “Status” column in the search results lets you know what you can submit for a particular publication:

+++ <details><summary> +++
+++ </summary><div> +++

== What will I need?

To submit summary statistics, you will need:

* Full validated summary statistics for each GWAS analysis
* A readme for each summary statistics file
* The md5 checksum for each summary statistics file
* Enough information about each GWAS to match it to the corresponding study entry in the pre-filled template

== Step 1: Create a submission

* Search by *PubMed ID* or *first author* to find your publication.
* Check that the publication has the status OPEN FOR SUMMARY STATISTICS SUBMISSION
* Click on the PubMed ID to go to the publication details page.
* Click “Create Submission”. You will be prompted to log in, if you haven’t already.
* You have now created a new Submission:
  ** The upper panel gives a summary of the publication.
  ** The lower panel shows the details of your submission, including the Submission ID, status and validation reports.
  ** The buttons on the left show the actions available to you.

== Step 2: Upload summary statistics

=== Option 1: Upload files using Globus

+++     <details><summary> +++
+++     </summary><div> +++

* When you create a submission, you will receive an email from Globus with the URL to your personal directory for uploading summary statistics files. Open the link to access the shared location.
* First log into globus. You must login using the same email account used to log into the GWAS deposition system. If you logged into GWAS deposition with your ELIXIR account, you can use the same account to log into Globus.

image::globus_1_login.jpeg[align="center"]

* After a successful login you should be able to view your personal directory for uploading files.
* If you are already familiar with Globus and have your summary stats files in an existing collection you can now transfer your files from your collection to this space.
* If you want to transfer files from your own personal computer, you will need to install the Globus application.
  ** Select “Transfer or Sync to…” from the right hand window.

+
image::globus_2_transfer_sync.jpeg[align="center"]
  
  ** The window will split and give you the option to select a collection.

+
image::globus_3_new_collection.jpeg[align="center"]

  ** Select the option to install the Globus Connect Personal application

+
image::globus_4_install_gcp.jpeg[align="center"]
  
  ** Give your collection a name so you can easily identify it.
  ** Generate a setup key and keep a note of the number.
  
+
image::globus_5_name_collection.jpeg[align="center"]
  
  ** Copy the setup key and install Globus Connect Personal on your computer. When you start Globus Connect on your computer it will ask you to enter the setup key.
  
+
image::globus_7_install_drag_drop.jpeg[align="center"]
image::globus_6_setup_key.jpeg[align="center"]
  
  ** Once Globus Connect Personal is successfully installed and running on your machine (it may run in the background, so check for the "g" icon in your toolbar), switch back to the Globus File Manager.
  ** Select the collection on the right hand side to change it.

+
image::globus_8_select_collection.jpeg[align="center"]

  ** Select “My collection” tab to find the collection you just created for your local computer.
  ** You should now see the EBI shared directory side by side with your own computer’s file system.
* At this point you can simply drag and drop the summary stats files you want to upload from the right window to the left window. Once done you will get an email notification that the transfer is complete. Note: You do not need to keep your browser window open, the transfer will continue in the background.

+++     </div></details> +++

=== Option 2: Upload files to another location

+++     <details><summary> +++
+++     </summary><div> +++

* Alternatively, you can store your summary statistics on your own personal or institutional website, or in a service like Google Drive or Dropbox.

+++     </div></details> +++

== Step 3: Download the submission template

* Return to the Submission page
* Click “Download template” to get a copy of the submission template. Save the template to your computer to complete offline.
* We generate a unique template for each publication containing important pre-filled data, so please remember to download a new template each time you submit a new publication.

== Step 4: Complete the submission spreadsheet (pre-filled metadata)

* For publications that are already included in the GWAS Catalog, you only need to match your summary statistics files to the study entries we have already created. To help you do this, the summary statistics submission template is pre-filled with basic meta-data for each study in the publication, including:

[cols="<4,<1,<10,<1,<6", options="header", grid="all", width=100%]

* The sample tab includes information about the samples included in each GWAS. Each GWAS should be listed separately, and within each GWAS, each group of samples should be on a separate row. Examples of sample groups are discovery/replication cohorts, and ancestry categories (e.g. European, East Asian, South Asian). 

For example:

* Your publication includes 2 GWAS analyses for different traits, each with a discovery and a replication stage (2 stages), in individuals with European or East Asian ancestry (2 broad ancestry categories)
* For each of the 2 GWAS you need to create rows for:
** discovery/European
** discovery/East Asian
** replication/European
** replication/East Asian, making 8 rows in total.

= [[checksums]] Calculating checksums for summary statistics files

In order to ensure the integrity of the uploaded summary statistics files before and after the upload, you must provide an md5 checksum (a kind of “fingerprint”) for each uploaded file. If there is any problem during the upload that leads to corruption of the data, this checksum will change. So by validating against the provided checksum, we can ensure the upload was successful and the data is not corrupted. Although there are various ways to calculate checksums, we are only supporting the most widely used md5 algorithm.

== Calculating on Mac computers

+++ <details><summary> +++
+++ </summary><div> +++

The md5 command line application is installed on Mac computers by default. Type the following into the command line, replacing “summary_stats.gzip” with the name of your own file:

  $ md5 summary_stats.gzip

The output should look something like this:
  
  MD5 (summary_stats.gzip) = 49ea8cf53801c7f1e2f11336fb8a29c8

The md5 checksum is the 32-digit hexadecimal number in the output, after the filename. Copy this number into the corresponding column of the study sheet.

+++ </div></details> +++

== Calculating on Linux/Unix computers

+++ <details><summary> +++
+++ </summary><div> +++

The md5sum command line application is installed on all Linux/Unix based systems by default. Type the following into the command line, replacing “summary_stats.gzip” with the name of your own file:

  $ md5sum summary_stats.gzip

The output should look something like this:

  4ab6d4f4db143eed49c248d3ce23cb57  summary_stats.gzip

The md5 checksum is the 32-digit hexadecimal number in the first column of the output, before the file name. Copy this number into the corresponding column of the study sheet.

+++ </div></details> +++

== Calculating on Windows computers

+++ <details><summary> +++
+++ </summary><div> +++

In Windows, you can use the certutil command line tool to calculate md5 checksums. Type the following into the command line, replacing “summary_stats.gzip” with the name of your own file:

  > certutil -hashfile summary_stats.gzip MD5

The output should look something like this:

  ...

The md5 checksum is the 32-digit hexadecimal number provided by the application. Copy this number into the corresponding column of the study sheet.
