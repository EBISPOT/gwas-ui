== [[A]]A. Preparing for submission

=== [[link-1]]Submission homepage

Start by going to the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/deposition[GWAS Catalog Submission homepage^].

=== [[link-2]]Format and validate summary statistics

Before submitting, you must ensure that your summary statistics files conform to our standard format, which makes your summary statistics interoperable with other datasets and helps others to make use of them. Click https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/summary-statistics-format[here] for full documentation on the requirements and https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/summary-statistics-format[instructions on using our formatter and validator tools], which can be run in the command line or via a web interface. We strongly recommend running the validator offline prior to upload, especially for large datasets.

=== [[link-3]]Submission questionnaire

Next, please provide some metadata about the broader body of work to which your summary statistics submission relates. For example, your submission might be linked to a publication or to an unpublished manuscript, or you may wish to submit summary statistics for GWAS experiments that are not currently written up in a manuscript format.

Click the "Get started" button from the Submission homepage and then follow the questionnaire to find the appropriate scenario.

==== Publications indexed in PubMed

GWAS publications that are indexed in PubMed should have already been identified by curators as eligible for inclusion in the GWAS Catalog. In this case, simply search for your publication by *PMID* (PubMed identifier) or *first author*. Publications matching your search are displayed in the table. 

image::pub_search.png[Publication search results,width=800,align="center"]

The Status of the publication tells you which type of data can be submitted.

[cols="<3,<1,<6", options="header", grid="all", width=100%]
|===
|Status
|
|Instructions

|OPEN FOR SUMMARY STATISTICS SUBMISSION
|
|The publication has been curated and the publication metadata is already available on the GWAS Catalog website. Please submit *summary statistics only*.

|OPEN FOR SUBMISSION
|
|The publication meets the GWAS Catalog’s inclusion criteria, but has not yet been curated. Please submit *summary statistics plus study metadata*.
  
|CLOSED
|
|We are not currently accepting submissions for this publication. We either have the summary statistics already, or the publication is under submission by another author or curator. You may want to check with your co-authors, or contact us at gwas-subs@ebi.ac.uk for more information.
|===

Once you have found your publication, click on the PMID to open the Details page.

A publication will not appear in the table if:

* it has not yet been indexed in PubMed
* it has been missed by our literature search, or
* we have determined that it does not meet our https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/methods/criteria[inclusion criteria]

If you think that we are missing an eligible publication, please contact us at gwas-subs@ebi.ac.uk.

==== Other scenarios

For all other scenarios, please complete the form to provide metadata about your manuscript or other body of work. Click "Submit" to continue to the Details page.

== [[B]]B. Creating a submission

The Details page gives a brief summary of the publication (or other body of work) and a list of prerequisites for submission. You will need to complete each of the items on the checklist before proceeding with the submission.

image::pre_sub_checklist.png[Pre-submission checklist,width=800,align="center"]

=== [[link-5]]1. Create Elixir ID

In order to create a submission, you will need to create an account and log in. User accounts are managed using the ELIXIR Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure, which is shared across multiple life science services. You can find https://elixir-europe.org/services/compute/aai[more information about ELIXIR here]. 

First, create an ELIXIR identity if you do not already have one: follow the https://elixir-europe.org/register[Elixir ID link^] and click Register. You can create an ELIXIR identity using an existing account, including Google, LinkedIn, ORCID and most academic institutions.

Second, using your ELIXIR identity, click on "ELIXIR LOGIN" on the GWAS Catalog Submission page to continue.

=== [[link-6]]2. Install Globus Connect Personal

We use Globus to enable the transfer of summary statistics files to the GWAS Catalog.

First, you will need to download and install the Globus Connect Personal application, which allows Globus to access files from your computer. Follow the https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal[Globus Connect Personal link^] and then select the appropriate link for your operating system.

image::gcp_install.png[Install GCP,width=400,align="center"]

{empty}

Then follow the *Installation* steps to install and run the application.

Take note of the email address associated with your Globus Connect Personal endpoint. You will need this for the next step.

image::globus_email.png[Publication search results,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

=== [[link-7]]3. Enter registered Globus email

Enter the email address associated with your Globus account. It should be filled automatically, but you can change it if needed.

image::enter_email2.png[Enter Globus email,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

=== [[link-8]]4. Format and validate summary statistics

Please confirm that your summary statistics files conform to our standard format and content, otherwise your submission will fail validation. If you haven’t already done so, follow the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/summary-statistics-format[Format and validate link^] for formatting instructions and to access our summary statistics formatting and validation tools.

=== [[link-9]]5. License agreement

Since March 2021, we have asked all submitters to agree to share their data under the terms of https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0[CC0]. This dedicates your data to the public domain, allowing downstream users to consume the data without restriction. This unambiguous declaration of free and open access is required for some downstream uses, e.g. to meet the data sharing requirements of certain journals, and maximise the utility of your data to the research community. Data submitted prior to March 2021 is made available under the EBI standard https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/terms-of-use[terms of use]. Whilst these terms do not themselves impose any restrictions on downstream use, the application of CC0 license removes any ambiguity. We advise consumers of data hosted by the GWAS Catalog to note the license terms of individual datasets, if applicable to their specific use case. Please ensure that the original data are cited whenever they are used in a publication.
If you have any questions or concerns about licensing, please contact us via gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk.

=== [[link-10]]6. Create submission

Please tick each box in the checklist to confirm that the prerequisites have been completed.

You can then click "Create Submission" to continue.

image::create_sub.png[Create Submission,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

== [[C]]C. Uploading data

After you have created a submission, you will be able to upload your summary statistics and supporting information. 

=== [[link-11]]1. Upload summary statistics

The first step is to upload your summary statistics files. When you create a submission, a folder is created for you. You can transfer your summary statistics to this location using Globus.

On the Submission Details page, click "Upload summary statistics" to open the Globus File Manager in a new tab.

image::upload_sum_stats.png[Upload summary statistics,width=300,align="center"]

{empty}

In the Globus File Manager, the GWAS Catalog submission folder will appear in the left-hand panel. It will have a Collection name beginning *ebi#gwas#*, followed by the creation date and some additional characters.

image::file_manager.png[Globus File Manager,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

In the right-hand panel, click on the Search box and then select your Globus Connect Personal endpoint from the *Your Collections* tab.  This should have the name that you entered when installing Globus Connect Personal in <<link-6, step B2>>.

image::search_collection.png[Search for your collection,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

image::select_collection.png[Select your collection,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

You should now see the GWAS Catalog submission folder side by side with your own computer’s file system.

Now you can drag and drop the summary stats files you want to upload from the right window to the left window. Please only upload data files in this window, and do not create any sub-directories, as this will prevent the submission pipeline from finding your files. 

image::drag_and_drop.png[Drag and drop summary statistics,width=800,align="center"]

{empty}

A message will appear when the transfer request has successfully started. Large files may take some time to transfer, but you do not need to wait until this is finished - the transfer will continue in the background while you proceed with the next step. You do however need to wait for confirmation of file transfer before clicking "Submit submission form" (step 3).

=== [[link-12]]2. Download submission form

You will now need to provide some additional information to support the summary statistics files.

Return to the Submission page and click "Download submission form" to download an Excel spreadsheet where you can enter this information. Save the form to your computer to complete offline.

image::download_form.png[Download submission form,width=300,align="center"]

{empty}

Please download a new form each time you create a new submission for a publication, to make sure you have the most correct and up-to-date form for your specific submission.

=== [[link-13]]3. Fill in submission form

For help filling in the submission form, follow the link from the submission interface, or select the relevant link below:

1. Instructions for https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/submission-summary-statistics[summary statistics only^], or

2. Instructions for https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/submission-summary-statistics-plus-metadata[summary statistics plus study metadata^]

=== [[link-14]]4. Submit submission form

Once you have completed the submission form, save it and click "Submit submission form".

image::submit_form.png[Submit submission form,width=300,align="center"]

{empty}

You can drag and drop the file onto the cloud icon, or click it to select the file from your computer. Click "Upload file" and then "Start validation".

image::upload_file.png[Upload file,width=600,align="center"]

image::start_validation.png[Start validation,width=500,align="center"]

{empty}

The validation pipeline first checks the uploaded submission form. If this passes, it goes on to check the summary statistics files themselves. Validation may take some time, but feel free to leave the page.

If the uploaded form and summary statistics pass validation, these will be automatically submitted. You will receive an email when validation is complete, with a list of accession number for the submitted studies.

If validation fails, you will receive an email listing the errors detected and a link back to the submission page. There you can click "Review submission" to download and edit the current submission form, and click "Reset" to delete the submission form and start again.

image::review_reset.png[Review or reset,width=300,align="center"]

=== [[link-15]]5. After submission - release of data in the Catalog & how to find your accession ID

Once your submission is complete, it will show as SUBMITTED and be listed on the "My Submissions" page.  Each GWAS is given an accession number starting with “GCST”. Please use the GCST accessions to cite in a manuscript - do not use the GCP ID for your submission as it won’t be findable on our website. To find these, click through to your submission page or follow the direct link from the confirmation email. There, you can download the list of accessions by clicking the “Download Accessions” button.

*- If you submitted after journal publication:* A curator will review your submission and make the summary statistics publicly available on the GWAS Catalog website as soon as possible. We’ll notify you when this happens.

*- For unpublished data or data linked to a preprint:* Your summary statistics will be available on our FTP server within 48 hours, or after your embargo period ends (if you’ve requested one). You can find the data here: GWAS FTP Server. The studies are grouped by accession number in sets of 1000. For example, for GCST90011111, you’ll find it at: http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/summary_statistics/GCST90011001-GCST90012000/GCST90011111/.

Our data release runs bi-weekly, so it may take a few days for your studies to appear on the GWAS Catalog website. Non-embargoed studies will be added to the summary statistics download area here: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/downloads/summary-statistics[Summary Statistics Downloads]. You can search for a study’s accession number on our homepage to find its landing page and metadata: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas[GWAS Homepage]. Additional metadata will be available in the downloadbale files here: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads[File Downloads]. If more than 2 weeks has passed and you have concerns, please contact us. 

*- When your pre-publication study is published:* We’ll update the metadata to include the PubMed citation, top associations, and ontology mappings. We check the literature weekly for matches to pre-published studies, so you don’t need to take further action. However, if you inform us when your paper is published, together with the PubMed ID, this can help to speed up the process.
