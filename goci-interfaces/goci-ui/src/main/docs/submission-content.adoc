=== [[link-1]]1. Log in to the submission page

First, open the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/deposition[GWAS Catalog Submission page^].

To get started, click LOGIN in the top right corner of the submission page.

Log in using your ELIXIR identity, or follow the link to register. Your ELIXIR identity may be linked to Google, LinkedIn, ORCID or an institutional account.

=== [[link-2]]2. Find publication

On the GWAS Catalog Submission page, you can find any publication that is included in the GWAS Catalog, or that has been identified by curators as eligible for inclusion.

You can search for a publication by *PubMed ID* or *first author*. Publications matching your search are displayed in the table.

==== What if my publication is not in the table?

A publication will not appear in the table if:

* it has not yet been indexed in PubMed
* it has been missed by our literature search, or
* curators have reviewed the publication and found that it does not meet our eligibility criteria

If you think that we are missing an eligible publication, or if you want to submit data that is not yet published, please contact us at gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk to request an eligibility review.

=== [[link-3]]3. Check publication status

Once you have found your publication, please take note of the Status. This will tell you which data to submit.
