_Related search terms:_ update schedule, release frequency, data refresh, biweekly updates, summary statistics availability, missing files

''' 

==== [[faqA8PublicationDelay]] Why is a newly published GWAS paper not yet in the GWAS Catalog?

Every publication added to the GWAS Catalog goes through detailed manual curation. This process takes time, so there is usually a delay between when a paper is first indexed in PubMed and when it appears in the Catalog.

The curation team works as quickly as possible while maintaining high accuracy standards. In most cases, new publications take several weeks to a few months before being included.

If a paper of interest is more than two months old and not visible in the Catalog, please contact gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk to confirm it has been identified and is in the curation queue. Publications of particular scientific or community interest may be prioritised.

_Related search terms:_ delay, missing study, new publication, curation backlog, PubMed indexing, processing time

''' 

==== [[faqA9InfrastructureCode]] Where can I find the GWAS Catalog infrastructure code?

The full GWAS Catalog infrastructure code is open source and freely available on GitHub: https://github.com/EBISPOT/goci  

This repository contains the codebase for the Catalog’s backend services, user interface, data processing pipelines, and related tools. It is actively maintained and updated by the EMBL-EBI SPOT team.

_Related search terms:_ source code, GitHub, infrastructure, backend, goci, open source, repository

''' 

==== [[faqA10PublicationVsStudy]] What is the difference between a publication and a study?

A *publication* is an article published in a scientific journal. Each publication is tracked in the GWAS Catalog using its unique PubMed ID.

A *study* refers to a specific genome-wide association analysis within a publication. One publication may include several studies if it reports distinct analyses (for example, different traits, sample cohorts, or statistical designs).  

Each study in the Catalog is assigned a stable accession number beginning with “GCST” (e.g., GCST000123). This accession uniquely identifies the analysis regardless of the publication it came from.

For more details on how we handle publications containing multiple analyses, see our https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/methods/curation[Curation methods] section.

_Related search terms:_ publication, study, PubMed ID, GCST accession, multiple analyses, difference

''' 

==== [[faqA11StudyAccession]] How do I find the accession number for a study?

Each study in the GWAS Catalog has a unique accession number beginning with “GCST” (for example, GCST000123).  

You can find study accession numbers in several places:  

* At the top of each “Study” page.  
* In the “Studies” and “Associations” data tables on Publication, Trait, Variant, and Gene pages.  
* In the downloadable spreadsheets (associations, studies, and ancestry files) from version v1.0.2 onwards.  

Note: Accession numbers are not included in the older v1.0 spreadsheets, which were only retained for backwards compatibility with the original NHGRI spreadsheet format.

_Related search terms:_ accession number, GCST, study ID, identifier, spreadsheet versions, legacy format

''' 

==== [[faqA12TraitVsReportedTrait]] What is the difference between a trait and a reported trait?

A *trait* in the GWAS Catalog is a standardised term from the http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo[Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO)]. Traits represent the disease, phenotype, measurement, or drug response being investigated. Each trait has its own page in the Catalog, showing all relevant studies and associated variants. For more about how ontologies are used, see our https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/ontology[ontology documentation].

A *reported trait* is taken directly from the authors’ description of the phenotype analysed in the study. Reported traits reflect the study design and context, and may include additional details such as environmental interactions or compound phenotypes.

Together, the standardised trait terms support consistent searching and comparison across studies, while the reported traits preserve the exact wording and design used by study authors.

_Related search terms:_ trait, reported trait, phenotype, EFO, ontology, study design, author description

''' 

==== [[faqA13BackgroundTrait]] What is a background trait?

A *background trait* is a characteristic shared by all participants in a study, but not directly tested in the association analysis.

For example:  

In a study of “Allergic rhinitis in asthma,” the comparison is cases (individuals with allergic rhinitis) vs. controls (individuals without allergic rhinitis). All participants have asthma.  

* The *main trait* under investigation is allergic rhinitis.  

* The *background trait* is asthma.  

The study cannot identify variants associated with asthma itself, but the fact that all participants have asthma provides important context for interpreting the allergic rhinitis associations.

The GWAS Catalog displays both main and background traits, clearly labelled, on study and association records. Background traits are also included in the most recent spreadsheet downloads (v1.0.3).

_Related search terms:_ background trait, main trait, study context, phenotype definition, allergic rhinitis, asthma

''' 

==== [[faqA14InteractionStudies]] How do I identify interaction studies in the GWAS Catalog?

The GWAS Catalog includes *SNP-by-SNP* and *SNP-by-environment* interaction studies, provided the SNPs meet genome-wide significance criteria.

*Identification in the UI and download files:*

* On the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/studies[Studies page], tick the **GxE** checkbox under "Select study type:" to filter the table to only Gene-by-Environment interaction studies. 
* The **GxE** column in any studies table indicates whether a GxE interaction study design (tick or “x”). This column can also be exported via the file or enabled/hidden using *Column visibility*. 
* The downloadable studies file includes the **GxE** field so you can filter programmatically. 

*Identification via reported trait:*

* SNP-by-SNP interactions include “SNP × SNP interaction” in parentheses.

* SNP-by-environment interactions include the environment in the description. As of July 2018, you’ll also see notation for test types: “(1df test)” or “(2df test)”, such as “Lung cancer × smoking interaction (1df test)”. Earlier studies may only say “(smoking interaction)”.

*Alternate navigation:*

* On any “Trait” page, search “interaction” in the “Associations” or “Studies” tables.

* In downloadable spreadsheets, filter the reported trait column for "interaction".

_Related search terms:_ GxE checkbox, interaction studies, filter, SNP-by-environment, SNP-by-SNP, 1df, 2df, trait search

''' 

==== [[faqA15TargetedExome]] How do I identify targeted and exome array studies in the GWAS Catalog?

Targeted and exome array studies are flagged in several ways:

*In the user interface:*  

* A small “target” icon appears in search results next to any publication that includes a targeted or exome array study.  

* The same icon is shown in the “Study accession” column of the Studies table on Publication, Trait, Variant, or Gene pages.  

*In downloads:*  

* In the downloadable studies file, these studies include an additional column called **Genotyping technology (additional array information)**.  

* This field records whether the study used a targeted genotyping array, exome array, or similar technology.  

For details on available download fields, see the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads[file downloads documentation].

_Related search terms:_ targeted array, exome array, genotyping technology, icon, study accession, download file

''' 

==== [[faqA16TargetedExomeScope]] Why are only certain targeted or exome array studies available in the GWAS Catalog?

The GWAS Catalog is gradually expanding to include large-scale targeted and non–genome-wide arrays such as the Metabochip, Immunochip, and Exome array.  

This expansion is currently in a pilot phase. During this phase, targeted and exome array studies are prioritised for inclusion based on:  

1. The scientific relevance of the trait analysed.  
2. Requests and feedback from users of the Catalog.  

As a result, only a subset of targeted or exome array studies are currently available, with more added over time as the pilot develops.

_Related search terms:_ targeted array, exome array, Metabochip, Immunochip, pilot phase, study inclusion criteria

''' 

==== [[faqA17CNVStudies]] Does the GWAS Catalog include CNV studies?

Copy number variant (CNV) studies are not currently within the scope of the GWAS Catalog for literature search and manual curation of associations.  

However, researchers may submit CNV study summary statistics directly to the Catalog. Submitted files and metadata are made publicly available, even though CNV associations are not curated in the same way as SNP-based GWAS.  

_Related search terms:_ CNV, copy number variation, structural variation, submission, summary statistics, study scope

''' 

==== [[faqA18ORvsBeta]] How can I separate odds ratios (OR) from beta values in the associations download?

In the full Catalog download, odds ratios (OR) and beta values share the same column. They can be distinguished because beta values always include a unit and direction (e.g. “unit increase,” “cm decrease”), which is recorded in the *95% CI (TEXT)* column.  

If you need OR and beta values in separate columns, use the download option from the Associations table on the web interface. The exported file mirrors the table view, where OR and beta appear in different columns.  

_Related search terms:_ odds ratio, beta, association file, download, effect size, confidence interval

''' 

==== [[faqA19AssociationUniqueness]] Is each association in the GWAS Catalog unique?

Each association in the Catalog comes from a distinct analysis.  

However, some associations may appear more than once because:  

* The same cohorts can be analysed in different ways across studies.  

* Component groups of a meta-analysis may be represented individually, in addition to the overall meta-analysis results.  

Users can check sample size and ancestry information as clues when apparent duplicates occur. For confirmation, always refer back to the source publication.  

_Related search terms:_ association uniqueness, duplicate associations, meta-analysis, cohort reuse, repeated analysis

''' 
==== [[faqA20SequencingScope]] Are results from sequencing-based association analyses included in the GWAS Catalog?

Yes — sequencing-based association analyses are now routinely curated and included in the GWAS Catalog, alongside array-based analyses.  

We curate significant associations from sequencing-based studies using the same manual process as for array-based GWAS, ensuring consistent quality and annotation.  

You can read more about the standards for reporting sequencing-based GWAS in  
https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(21)00005-7[McMahon et al., Sequencing-based genome-wide association studies reporting standards, Cell Genomics (2021)].  

You can identify sequencing-based studies by downloading the studies file from the  
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads[file downloads page]  
and filtering the **Genotyping technology (additional array information)** column for sequencing-based technologies (e.g., whole-genome sequencing, exome sequencing).  

_Related search terms:_ sequencing-based GWAS, whole-genome sequencing, WGS, exome sequencing, curated studies, reporting standards, genotyping technology filter

''' 

==== [[faqA21SmallPvalues]] How does the GWAS Catalog represent extremely small p-values?

Some publications report association p-values as 0. This usually happens when the analysis software cannot represent extremely small numbers.  

When authors cannot provide the exact value, the GWAS Catalog records the threshold instead. For example, if the publication reports *p < 1e-300*, the Catalog records it as *1e-300*.  

Note that the true p-value may be much smaller than the recorded threshold.  

_Related search terms:_ p-value, extremely small p-value, zero p-value, threshold, statistical precision, significance

''' 

==== [[faqA22UnpublishedData]] Does the GWAS Catalog include data that is not linked to a PubMed-indexed publication?

Yes. Since 2020, the GWAS Catalog has accepted submissions of unpublished GWAS. This includes:  

* Preprints.  

* Articles in press.  

* Standalone datasets not yet published in a journal.  

Unpublished data is made publicly available as submitted by authors. It is not manually reviewed by curators until the study is published in a journal.  

*Where to find unpublished data:*  

* Study pages for each accession number (GCST).  

* The https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/downloads[unpublished download files].  

* The ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/summary_statistics/[FTP site] and https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/downloads/summary-statistics[summary statistics page].  

Once a study is published, it is curated, annotated, and extended with top associations before being fully incorporated into the main database.  

_Related search terms:_ unpublished GWAS, preprint, in press, standalone dataset, submission, summary statistics, curation status

''' 

==== [[faqA23MouseOrthologs]] How can I find mouse orthologs for GWAS Catalog genes in IMPC?

Each gene in the GWAS Catalog that has a known mouse ortholog in the https://www.mousephenotype.org/[International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC)] is linked via a button on the gene page.  

Orthology predictions come from IMPC’s reference database, which is updated weekly to include the latest HCOP ortholog relationships and data from MGI.  

If no ortholog has been established for a gene, the IMPC button will not appear.  

For details on ortholog mapping, see the IMPC https://www.mousephenotype.org/help/data-integration/how-to-use-the-essential-genes-data-portal/0[documentation] and the publication https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14284-2[Cacheiro et al., Nature Communications (2020)].  

_Related search terms:_ mouse ortholog, IMPC, HCOP, MGI, gene mapping, orthology

''' 

==== [[faqA24TopAssociations]] What are "top associations"?

*Top associations* are the curated set of associations displayed in the Catalog’s Associations tables. They are manually extracted from published articles and filtered using the GWAS Catalog curation process.  

To be included as a top association, a result must:  

* Be significant at p < 1 × 10⁻⁵ in all stages of the analysis.  

* Be described as independent by the authors, or represent the peak association within a 100 kb region.  

Top associations differ from full summary statistics. Summary statistics include all associations discovered in a GWAS, regardless of independence or significance, while top associations provide a focused list of the most relevant results.  

_Related search terms:_ top associations, significant SNPs, independent signals, peak SNP, summary statistics, curation criteria

''' 

== [[B]]B. Searching the GWAS Catalog

==== [[faqB1SearchCatalog]] How do I search the GWAS Catalog?

Enter your query (e.g. “breast carcinoma”) into the search box and press return or click the search icon.  

The search will return results across multiple entity types:  

* **Publications** (marked with “P”)  

* **Variants** (marked with “V”)  

* **Traits** (marked with “T”)  

You can refine the results using the “Refine search results” panel on the left to filter by entity type.  

_Related search terms:_ search, query, publication search, trait search, variant search, filter, refine results

'''

=== B(i). Searching by publication

==== [[faqB2SearchPublication]] How do I search by publication?

You can search for a publication using:  

* The PubMed ID.  

* Any author name.  

* Words from the publication title.  

All authors listed in a paper are indexed in the Catalog. Searching by author will return every publication that includes that name, not just first-author papers. This may produce a large number of results.  

For the most precise results, use the PubMed ID.  

_Related search terms:_ publication search, PubMed ID, author search, title search, publication results

'''

==== [[faqB3AuthorSearchResults]] Why do author searches also return traits?

The search function matches your text across all fields in the Catalog.  

For example, a search for “Parkinson” will return:  

* Publications with an author named Parkinson.  

* Publications with “Parkinson” in the title.  

* Traits related to Parkinson’s disease.  

If you only want a specific publication, use its PubMed ID for the most accurate result.  

_Related search terms:_ author search, trait overlap, publication search, text match, PubMed ID

'''

=== B(ii). Searching by variant or gene

==== [[faqB4SearchVariant]] How do I search by variant?

You can search for a variant (single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP) in several ways:  

* By rsID (e.g., rs12345).  

* By genomic region (e.g., 6:16000000-25000000 or 2q37.1).  

* By a gene that is mapped to the variant.  

Searching by gene or region may return many results, so if you are looking for one specific variant, the rsID is the most precise option.  

Variants are mapped to genes using the GWAS Catalog’s genomic annotation pipeline, which includes Ensembl-based mapping of nearby or overlapping genes.  

_Related search terms:_ variant search, SNP, rsID, genomic region, gene mapping, Ensembl annotation

'''

==== [[faqB5SearchGene]] How do I search by gene?

Enter a gene symbol (e.g., STAT4) into the main search bar. The search will return:  

* The gene itself.  

* Variants annotated with that gene by the Catalog’s mapping pipeline.  

* Publications that include the gene name in the title.  

The “Gene” page lists all associations mapped to that gene and provides related gene-specific information.  

Note: the mapped gene may not always match the gene reported by authors. Different criteria can be used for reporting, so author-reported genes may differ.  

Author-reported genes were curated until 2021. They can still be found in the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads[full data download]. To view them:  

* Open the file in Excel.  

* Filter the **REPORTED GENE(S)** column for your gene of interest.  

You can also use the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/rest/docs/api[REST API] to retrieve associations for a specific gene or genomic region.  

_Related search terms:_ gene search, gene page, reported gene, mapped gene, REPORTED GENE(S), REST API, curation cutoff 2021

==== [[faqB6SearchRegion]] How do I search by genomic region?

You can search by genomic region using either:  

* Chromosome coordinates in the format `chromosome:start-end` (e.g., `6:16000000-25000000`).  

* Cytogenetic band notation (e.g., `2q37.1`).  

Both methods return a list of genes and variants located within the specified region.  

_Related search terms:_ region search, chromosomal coordinates, cytogenetic band, SNP location, genomic interval

'''

=== B(iii). Searching by trait
==== [[faqB8SearchTrait]] How do I search by trait?

Type the name of a disease, phenotype, measurement, or drug response into the search bar.  

The search will return:  

* Traits that exactly match your term.  

* Synonyms of matching traits.  

* Child traits (e.g., searching “cancer” also returns cancer subtypes).  

* Publications where the title contains your search term.  

If you cannot find your trait of interest, it may be stored under a synonym. For example, searching “general cognitive ability” returns “intelligence,” which is the standardised trait name in the Catalog.  

The search bar also offers auto-suggestions, including synonyms, as you type.  

_Related search terms:_ trait search, phenotype, synonym, child term, ontology, auto-complete

'''

==== [[faqB9TraitPublications]] When I search for a trait, do the results include all publications for that trait?

No. A publication will only appear in search results if the title, author list, or PubMed ID contains your search term.  

To see all studies linked to a trait, go to the trait’s dedicated page and view the **Studies** table. This table lists every study associated with that trait, even if the publication title does not mention it.  

_Related search terms:_ trait search, publication results, study table, PubMed ID, trait page

'''

==== [[faqB10OtherTraitsReturned]] Why do other traits appear in my search results?

Search results can include more than just exact matches to your term. They may also include:  

* **Synonyms and child traits** — for example, searching “thyroid disease” also returns “Hashimoto’s thyroiditis” and “Graves disease,” which are subtypes of thyroid disease.  

* **Traits studied in combination with your trait** — for example, searching “asthma” also returns “response to bronchodilator,” because a GWAS studied that response in individuals with asthma.  

* **Publications** — if the publication title contains your search term.  

These connections come from the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO), which defines synonyms, hierarchical relationships, and trait combinations. This allows the Catalog to support more comprehensive searches, even when studies describe traits in different ways.  

_Related search terms:_ trait search, child trait, ontology, synonyms, compound trait, EFO

'''

==== [[faqB11CompoundTraits]] How are multiple or compound traits represented in the Catalog?

Some studies are mapped to more than one trait when the phenotype definition is complex. The Catalog records both standardised ontology traits and the *reported trait* taken directly from the publication.  

* **Combined groups (“or”):**  
  If a study compares groups with different traits to a shared control group, the reported trait uses “or.”  
  Example: “bipolar disorder or schizophrenia” → mapped to both “bipolar disorder” and “schizophrenia.”  

* **Individuals with multiple traits (“and”):**  
  If a study analyses individuals with more than one trait, the reported trait uses “and.”  
  Example: “bipolar disorder and binge eating” → mapped to both “bipolar disorder” and “binge eating.”  

* **Biobank and code-based traits:**  
  Reported traits that include phrases like “UKB data field” or ICD codes may appear exactly as written in the publication. These cases may not follow standard naming conventions. Users should consult the source (e.g., https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/index.cgi) for details.  

_Related search terms:_ compound trait, multiple traits, reported trait, ontology, UK Biobank, ICD codes

'''

==== [[faqB12BackgroundTraits]] How are background traits represented in the Catalog?

A *background trait* is a characteristic shared by all participants in a study, but not directly tested in the association analysis.  
Example: In a study of “Allergic rhinitis in asthma,” the main trait is allergic rhinitis, while asthma is the background trait.  

*Representation in the UI:*  

* On each Study page, background traits are shown in a separate field from the main trait.  

* Studies and Associations tables include columns for both main and background traits.  

* The Trait page, by default, shows only main traits. To also include studies where that trait is a background trait, tick the **“Include background traits data”** box above the data tables. This also updates the association plot.  

*In downloads:*  

* Background traits are included in the most recent spreadsheet version (v1.0.3) under the columns **MAPPED BACKGROUND TRAIT** and **MAPPED BACKGROUND TRAIT URI**.  

* Earlier spreadsheet versions only include main traits.  

*Programmatic access:*  

* The REST API currently only returns main traits, but background trait access may be added in the future.  

_Related search terms:_ background trait, main trait, study context, spreadsheet, API, asthma, allergic rhinitis

'''

==== [[faqB13NoResults]] Why did my search return no results even though I expected a match?

The GWAS Catalog search looks for exact text string matches. Small differences in wording or spelling can affect results.  

Examples:  

* Typing “beast cancer” instead of “breast cancer” will return nothing.  

* Searching “metabolic disorder” gives no matches, while “metabolic disease” returns many.  

Tips if your search fails: 

* Use the auto-complete suggestions offered in the search bar.  

* Try alternative terms or synonyms.  

* Check the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo to see if your trait is stored under a different name.  

_Related search terms:_ no results, spelling error, synonyms, auto-complete, EFO

'''

=== B(iv). Searching by study
==== [[faqB14SearchStudy]] Can I search for a study?

Studies are not returned directly in search results. To find a study:  

* Search for a related publication, trait, or variant, then open the **Studies** table to see linked studies.  

* If you already know the accession number (e.g. GCST000123), you can enter it in the search bar on the homepage. This will return the publication that contains the study, with a link to the study page.  

_Related search terms:_ study search, GCST, accession number, study table

'''

==== [[faqB15SearchTargetedExome]] How can I search for targeted and exome array studies and associations?

To find targeted or exome array studies:  

*In the search bar:*  
Enter the genotyping technology term (e.g. “targeted genotyping array” or “exome genotyping array”). This will return publications that used that array.  

*In the user interface:*  
Targeted and exome array studies are flagged with a small **target icon** in search results and in the **Study accession** column of the Studies table.  

*In downloads:*  
The downloadable studies file includes a column called **Genotyping technology (additional array information)**, which records whether a study used a targeted genotyping array, exome array, or similar technology.  

_Related search terms:_ targeted array, exome array, genotyping technology, icon, study accession, download file

==== [[faqC2AssociationPlot]] How do I use the association plot on a Trait page?

The association plot shows all associations for the selected trait as circles on a genome-wide view.  

*Circles:* Each circle represents a variant–trait association.  

*Colour coding:* Circles are coloured by broad trait category (see the legend in the top-left corner of the plot).  

*Interaction:* Hover or click on a circle to view detailed information about that variant (e.g., p-value, mapped gene, study).  

*Download:* Use the download button to save an image of the plot.  

The association plot is powered by the https://statgen.github.io/locuszoom[LocusZoom plugin].  

_Related search terms:_ association plot, trait page, visualisation, LocusZoom, genome-wide view, download plot

'''

==== [[faqC3LDPlot]] How do I use the linkage disequilibrium (LD) plot on a Variant page?

The LD plot shows the strength of linkage disequilibrium between the selected variant and nearby variants within a 50 kb region, using data from Ensembl.  

*Controls:*  

* Choose a population and LD metric (r² or D′) from the dropdown menus.  

* Adjust the LD threshold to focus on stronger or weaker correlations.  

*Download:*  
You can download the LD data as a .tsv file directly from the plot interface.  

*Programmatic access:*  
LD data can also be retrieved via the Ensembl REST API: http://rest.ensembl.org/documentation/info/ld_pairwise_get.  
Specify the variant ID, window size, population, and threshold. For multiple variants, make separate API calls.

==== [[faqD2FilterDiagram]] How do I filter the diagram?
You can filter the diagram by clicking trait categories in the sidebar on the left. At this time, filtering by individual traits is not supported. If you need more specific trait filtering, contact us at gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk.  

_Related search terms:_ diagram filter, trait category, sidebar filter, specific trait filter  


'''

==== [[faqD3DiagramLegend]] What are the trait categories shown on the diagram?
The sidebar also includes a colour legend with a count of dots in each category. Clicking a category highlights only those associations.  

Some traits belong to multiple categories (e.g. Crohn’s disease is both a digestive system and immune system disease). Each dot is assigned a single colour, based on its “most specific ancestor” in EFO.  

_Related search terms:_ trait categories, colour legend, EFO ancestor, disease categories

_Related search terms:_ filtered diagram download, trait subset diagram, SVG export, screenshot

'''

== [[E]]E. Genomic mappings

==== [[faqE1GenomicAnnotation]] How is the genomic annotation for each SNP provided?

The GWAS Catalog uses an Ensembl-based mapping pipeline to add genomic information for each SNP, including chromosome position, cytogenetic band, and mapped genes.  

If a SNP falls inside a gene, that gene is reported. If the SNP is intergenic, the nearest upstream and downstream genes within 50 kb are reported.  

Mapping information is refreshed with every Ensembl release (roughly every 2–3 months).  

For more detail, you can use the GWAS Catalog REST API to retrieve all Ensembl and RefSeq genes within 50 kb of a SNP.

_Related search terms:_ SNP mapping, genomic annotation, Ensembl pipeline, gene mapping, intergenic SNP, upstream gene, downstream gene, genome build

'''

==== [[faqE2GenomeBuild]] Which genome build is used in the GWAS Catalog?

++++
Data in the GWAS Catalog is currently mapped to genome assembly <span id="genomeBuild">GRCh38.p14</span> and dbSNP Build <span id="dbSNP">156</span>.
++++

This information is updated on release and displayed at the bottom of the GWAS Catalog's home page.

_Related search terms:_ genome build, GRCh38, dbSNP build 156, reference genome, assembly version

'''

==== [[faqE3AlternativeGenomeBuilds]] How can I access GWAS Catalog data on alternative genome builds?

The GWAS Catalog itself uses GRCh38, but you can remap SNPs to older builds such as GRCh37.  

*Options for remapping:*  

* **Ensembl REST API:** Use the [Ensembl API](http://rest.ensembl.org/) to map rsIDs to earlier assemblies. For GRCh37, use [http://grch37.rest.ensembl.org/](http://grch37.rest.ensembl.org/) and the [variation endpoint](http://grch37.rest.ensembl.org/documentation/info/variation_id) to retrieve dbSNP mappings.  

* **NCBI Remap Tool:** Use [NCBI’s Remap](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap) to convert genomic coordinates between assemblies.  

_Related search terms:_ alternative genome builds, GRCh37, liftover, Ensembl REST API, NCBI Remap, assembly mapping, rsID conversion

'''

==== [[faqE4MissingSnpMapping]] Why do some SNPs have no mapping information?

Some SNPs in the GWAS Catalog do not have genomic coordinates or gene mappings.  

*Possible reasons:*  

* **Typos or unusual identifiers:** If a publication contains a typographical error or reports a non-standard SNP ID, the mapping pipeline may fail to find a match.  
* **Retired SNPs:** Some SNPs no longer exist in the latest genome build used by the Catalog. These SNP IDs are still displayed for completeness, but mapping data is not available.  

_Related search terms:_ missing SNP mapping, unplaced SNP, dbSNP retired, unmapped variant, genome build issues, SNP identifier error

'''

==== [[faqE5SnpInteractionsHaplotypes]] How are SNP-SNP interactions and multi-SNP haplotypes shown?

The GWAS Catalog represents interactions and haplotypes using clear separators so that you can match each SNP’s details across fields.

* **SNP-SNP interactions:** Elements are separated by `x`.  
  Example: `rs1336472-A x rs4715555-G` shows the rsID and allele for each SNP. The same separator is used for chromosome locations (`1p31.3 x 6p12.1`) and variant consequences (`3_prime_UTR_variant x upstream_gene_variant`).  

* **Multi-SNP haplotypes:** Elements are separated by `;`.  
  Example:  
  
  * `rs17310467-?; rs6088735-?; rs6060278-?; rs867186-?`  
  
  * `MYH7B; EDEM2 - PROCR; EDEM2 - PROCR; PROCR`  
  Each position corresponds across columns — the first rsID matches the first mapped gene, first location, and so on.  

*Download files:*  
Mapped gene and position info are included, but complex data such as upstream/downstream gene IDs and distances are excluded to keep the spreadsheets usable. For large haplotypes, this avoids confusing mismatches where some SNPs are intragenic and others intergenic.


_Related search terms:_ SNP interaction display, haplotype format, rsID separator, multi-SNP annotation, x separator, semicolon separator, mapped gene alignment

'''

==== [[faqE6MostSevereConsequence]] What does the "Most severe consequence" or "CONTEXT" field mean?

This field shows the predicted *most severe functional effect* of a variant, based on Ensembl’s consequence ranking.  

A variant can affect multiple transcripts in different ways (for example, intronic in one transcript and missense in another). The Catalog only reports the single most severe consequence across all transcripts.  

You can find definitions of each consequence term and their severity ranking in Ensembl’s documentation:  
https://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/variation/prediction/predicted_data.html#consequences  

_Related search terms:_ most severe consequence, variant effect, VEP, Ensembl consequence ranking, transcript annotation, functional effect

'''

==== [[faqE7RiskAlleleMismatch]] Why does the risk allele sometimes not match the reference genome?

Risk alleles in the GWAS Catalog are taken exactly as reported in the original publication.  

Occasionally, the curated risk allele does not match either allele in the current reference genome assembly. This can happen for several reasons, most commonly *strand flipping* between genome builds (for example, if the study was reported on an older build).  

Because authors do not always report which genome build they used, the Catalog cannot systematically correct for these discrepancies.  

For a detailed discussion of this issue, see:  
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36465187/[Sheng et al. 2022]  

_Related search terms:_ risk allele mismatch, strand flipping, genome build differences, allele orientation, reference genome discrepancy

'''

== F. Population descriptors

==== [[faqF1PopulationDescriptors]] How are population descriptors provided in the GWAS Catalog?

The GWAS Catalog represents population information using a standardised framework:  

* **Detailed sample description** — captures the author-provided description of each sample

* **Ancestry category label** — assigns each sample to a controlled vocabulary category (e.g. European, East Asian) to make data easier to group and compare across studies.  

This two-level approach allows both detailed interpretation and high-level filtering of studies.  

For more information, see the GWAS Catalog’s https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/ancestry[Ancestry Documentation].  

_Related search terms:_ population descriptors, ancestry category, sample metadata, population standardisation, controlled vocabulary

'''

==== [[faqF2SearchPopulationDescriptors]] How do I search for population descriptors in the GWAS Catalog?

You can search for specific population descriptors using the **Studies table** on any Trait, Publication, Gene, or Variant page, via the **Discovery/Replication Sample Number** (default) or **Discovery/Replication Sample Description** columns (enable these via *Column visibility*).  

For more details, see the GWAS Catalog’s https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/ancestry[Ancestry Documentation].  

_Related search terms:_ population search, ancestry search, discovery sample, replication sample, column visibility, sample metadata

'''

==== [[faqF3FindAssociationsByAncestry]] Can I find all associations with a particular ancestry label?

The GWAS Catalog website does not yet provide a direct way to view all associations for a given ancestry label.  

You can:  

* Use the **REST API** to filter and retrieve associations by ancestry.  

* Download the full ancestry metadata file (includes country of recruitment and additional sample information) from the http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads[GWAS Catalog download page].  

* See the http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/fileheaders#_file_headers_for_ancestry_download[file header descriptions] for details about the fields.  

_Related search terms:_ ancestry label search, population filter, ancestry download file, REST API ancestry, sample metadata

'''

==== [[faqF4Pre2011AncestryFlag]] What does the "Pre-2011 ancestry not double-curated" flag mean?

This flag indicates that the ancestry metadata for that study was curated before 2011 and has not been reviewed by a second curator.  

Because it was single-curated, the information may not fully follow the strict, standardised approach used for more recent studies. The data is still publicly available but should be interpreted with this limitation in mind.  

_Related search terms:_ pre-2011 ancestry, double-curation, population descriptors, curation quality, metadata review

'''

==== [[faqF5AncestrySeparateFile]] Why is detailed sample metadata in a separate "Ancestry data" spreadsheet?

Each GWAS study usually has multiple sets of sample metadata — for example, one for the discovery stage and another for the replication stage — and some studies have several entries per stage.  

Because this information is multi-dimensional, it cannot be easily represented in a single row of the main studies file. To keep the data clear and usable, each ancestry label is listed on its own row in a separate spreadsheet called the "Ancestry data" file.  

_Related search terms:_ ancestry spreadsheet, sample metadata, discovery stage, replication stage, ancestry file format, multi-dimensional data

'''

==== [[faqF6CohortField]] What is included in the COHORT field?

The **COHORT** field lists the discovery stage (genome-wide) cohorts used in each study.  
Cohort names are extracted from the literature and matched to a predefined list that is shared with the PGS Catalog.  

*Key details:*  

* The predefined list was first compiled from Mills & Rahal (2019): https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-018-0261-x.  

* A downloadable list of cohort abbreviations and full names is available here: https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/spot/pgs/metadata/pgs_all_metadata_cohorts.csv.  

* Because the list is shared with the PGS Catalog, some cohorts may not currently appear in GWAS studies.  

* If a cohort is not in the predefined list or is not clearly described, the field will show “other.”  

* If no cohort was reported in the paper, the field will show “NR.”  

* Older studies (curated before ~2020) may have an empty COHORT field.  

*Note:* Cohorts listed in unpublished download files have not yet undergone curation and may not exactly match the predefined list.  

_Related search terms:_ cohort field, GWAS cohorts, discovery stage, PGS Catalog, cohort abbreviations, NR, other, missing cohort info

== [[H]]H. Summary statistics

==== [[faqH1SummaryStats]] What are summary statistics?

**Summary statistics** are the complete set of association results from a genome-wide association study (GWAS).  
They include every variant tested in the study, along with effect sizes, p-values, standard errors, and other metadata — not just the top significant hits.  

The GWAS Catalog curates the most significant associations (p < 1×10⁻⁵) for display in the website tables, but we also make available the full summary statistics files where possible. These provide a comprehensive view of the study and are essential for downstream analyses such as meta-analysis, fine-mapping, and polygenic score development.  

_Related search terms:_ summary statistics, full GWAS results, complete dataset, effect sizes, p-values, meta-analysis, polygenic risk score, GWAS download

'''

==== [[faqH2FindSummaryStats]] How do I find out which publications have full summary statistics available?

Studies with available summary statistics are marked with an icon in the results of the homepage search, as well as indicated on publication and study pages.  

You can also browse the complete list of studies (published and unpublished) with available summary statistics on the  
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/downloads/summary-statistics[Summary Statistics page].  

Files are usually released as soon as possible — sometimes even before the study is included in the Catalog’s regular biweekly data release.  
If a publication states that summary statistics are available but you cannot find them in the list or on the  
http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/summary_statistics/[FTP site], contact gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk to request access.

==== [[faqH5HarmonisedSummaryStats]] What are standardised or harmonised summary statistics?

**Standardised (or harmonised) summary statistics** are summary statistics files that have been processed to follow a consistent format and set of field names, regardless of how they were originally submitted.  

Harmonisation ensures that:  

* Column names and file structure are standardised.  

* Key fields such as rsID, chromosome, position, effect allele, other allele, effect size, and p-value are present and consistently formatted.  

* Data can be easily combined across multiple studies for meta-analysis or downstream applications.  

These harmonised files are available through the GWAS Catalog FTP site and summary statistics REST API when processing is complete.

'''

==== [[faqH6PrivacyRisksSummaryStats]] What are the privacy risks of sharing summary statistics?

Current consensus in the genetics community is that the benefits of openly sharing summary statistics outweigh the risks to participant privacy.  

A 2008 study by Homer et al. (PMID:18769715) showed it was theoretically possible to detect whether a specific individual participated in a study if: 

* Their personal genotype data was publicly available, **and**  

* Summary-level allele frequencies from the study were also available.  

Since then, multiple studies and reviews (including Craig et al., 2011, PMID:21921928) have assessed the risks and concluded that the risk is low.  

The NIH supports open sharing of summary statistics, including allele frequencies, as stated in its guidance:  

* https://osp.od.nih.gov/2018/11/01/provide-access-gsr/  

* https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-19-023.html

'''

==== [[faqH7CC0License]] Why do some datasets have a CC0 license mark?

Since March 2021, all new submissions to the GWAS Catalog require data contributors to agree to share their data under the  
https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/[CC0 license].  

CC0 dedicates the data to the public domain, allowing unrestricted reuse and removing any ambiguity about downstream use.
