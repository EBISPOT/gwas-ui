== Submitting summary statistics plus metadata

:imagesdir: ./images
:data-uri:

For publications that are not yet included in the GWAS Catalog, or for pre-publication submissions, we ask you to submit metadata in addition to the summary statistics files.

Instructions are provided below. When you have completed the submission form, return to the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/submission[main submission instructions^].

=== Data for you to enter

There are 2 tabs in the submission form for you to complete:

1. <<studies, Studies>>
2. <<samples, Samples>>

In each tab, mandatory columns are highlighted in orange. Grey columns are optional. However, we encourage you to submit as much information as you can.

=== [[studies]]1. Study tab

In the Study tab, please add one row for each separate GWAS analysis (study) in the submission. In particular, please make sure that there is one row for each set of summary statistics (i.e. each full set of p-values) that you have uploaded. For example, if you performed GWAS analyses for 100 different metabolite measurements, there should be 100 rows - one for each metabolite.

There are 16 columns for you to fill in:

[cols="<4,<1,<6,<1,<2,<1,<4,<1,<4", options="header", grid="all", width=100%]

=== [[samples]]2. Sample tab

In the Sample tab, enter information about the samples included in each GWAS.

Each GWAS should be listed separately, within each GWAS, each group of samples should be on a separate row. Examples of sample groups are discovery/replication cohorts, and ancestry categories (e.g. European, East Asian, South Asian).

For example, if your submission includes 2 GWAS analyses for different traits (i.e. 2 studies), each with a discovery and a replication stage (2 stages), in individuals with European or East Asian ancestry (2 broad ancestry categories), then you will need to create:

* 2 studies x 2 stages x 2 ancestry categories = *8 rows in total*

The screenshot below shows how this should look in the sample tab (note some columns are hidden to make the example clearer):
